# data structures

- binary search trees
- queues
- singly linked lists & doubly linked lists
- undirected unweighted graphs & directed graphs
- binary heaps
- hash tables
- stacks

### what do they do

- data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

### why are they so many

- different data structures excel at different things. some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

### why care

- the more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures.
- ie. need an ordered list (like an array) but with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end of data. the answer would be a linked list.
- ie. web scraping nested HTML? tree.
- id. need to write a scheduler? binary heap.
