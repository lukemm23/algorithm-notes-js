# comparing bubble, selection and insertion sort

![comparing elementary sorting](/images/elementary-sorting-algo-bigO.png)

- both bubble sort and insertion sort works best with nearly sorted data. see best case scenario bigO in image above.
- if the goal is to minimize the number of swaps, then selection sort could be a good choice.
- if a data set has one unsorted value coming in and needs to be sorted against large sorted portion then insertion sort will be a great choice.
